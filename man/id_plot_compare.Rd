\title{Function to compare two fitted idealstan models by plotting ideal points. Assumes that underlying data
is the same for both models.}
\usage{
id_plot_compare(
  model1 = NULL,
  model2 = NULL,
  scale_flip = FALSE,
  return_data = FALSE,
  labels = NULL,
  hjust = -0.1,
  palette = "Set1",
  color_direction = 1,
  text_size_label = 2,
  rescale = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model1}{The first model to compare}

\item{model2}{The second model to compare}

\item{scale_flip}{This parameter is set to true if you have two models that are reflected around the ideal point axis. This can happen as a result of identification and is harmless.}

\item{return_data}{Whether to return the underlying data}

\item{labels}{\code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE}, whether to use labels for points}

\item{hjust}{The horizontal adjustment of point labels}

\item{palette}{\code{colorbrewer} palette name}

\item{color_direction}{Whether to reverse the color scale}

\item{text_size_label}{Size of point labels}

\item{rescale}{Whether to rescale the estimates from two models so they will match regardless of arbitrary scale shifts in the
ideal points}
}
