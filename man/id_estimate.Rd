\arguments{
\item{idealdata}{An object produced by the \code{\link{id_make}} 
containing a score/vote matrix for use for estimation & plotting}

\item{model_type}{An integer reflecting the kind of model to be estimated. 
See below.}

\item{inflate_zero}{If the outcome is distributed as Poisson (count/unbounded integer), 
setting this to 
\code{TRUE} will fit a traditional zero-inflated model. 
To use correctly, the value for 
zero must be passed as the \code{miss_val} option to \code{\link{id_make}} before
running a model so that zeroes are coded as missing data.}

\item{vary_ideal_pts}{Default \code{'none'}. If \code{'random_walk'}, \code{'AR1'} or 
\code{'GP'}, a 
time-varying ideal point model will be fit with either a random-walk process, an 
AR1 process or a Gaussian process. See documentation for more info.}

\item{keep_param}{A list with logical values for different categories of paremeters which
should/should not be kept following estimation. Can be any/all of \code{person_int} for 
the person-level intercepts (static ideal points), 
\code{person_vary} for person-varying ideal points,
\code{item} for observed item parameters (discriminations/intercepts),
\code{item_miss} for missing item parameters (discriminations/intercepts),
and \code{extra} for other parameters (hierarchical covariates, ordinal intercepts, etc.).
Takes the form \code{list(person_int=TRUE,person_vary=TRUE,item=TRUE,item_miss=TRUE,extra=TRUE)}.
If any are missing in the list, it is assumed that those parameters will be excluded.
If \code{NULL} (default), will save all parameters in output.}

\item{grainsize}{The grainsize parameter for the \code{reduce_sum} 
function used for within-chain parallelization. The default is 1, 
which means 1 chunk (item or person) per core. Set to -1. to use}

\item{mpi_export}{If \code{within_chains="mpi"}, this parameter should refer to the 
directory where the necessary data and Stan code will be exported to. If missing, 
an interactive dialogue will prompt the user for a directory.}

\item{use_subset}{Whether a subset of the legislators/persons should be used instead of the full response matrix}

\item{sample_it}{Whether or not to use a random subsample of the response matrix. Useful for testing.}

\item{subset_group}{If person/legislative data was included in the \code{\link{id_make}} function, then you can subset by
any value in the \code{$group} column of that data if \code{use_subset} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{subset_person}{A list of character values of names of persons/legislators to use to subset if \code{use_subset} is 
\code{TRUE} and person/legislative data was included in the \code{\link{id_make}} function with the required \code{$person.names}
column}

\item{sample_size}{If \code{sample_it} is \code{TRUE}, this value reflects how many legislators/persons will be sampled from
the response matrix}

\item{nchains}{The number of chains to use in Stan's sampler. Minimum is one. See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more info.}

\item{niters}{The number of iterations to run Stan's sampler. Shouldn't be set much lower than 500. See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more info.}

\item{use_vb}{Whether or not to use Stan's variational Bayesian inference engine instead of full Bayesian inference. Pros: it's much faster.
Cons: it's not quite as accurate. See \code{\link[rstan]{vb}} for more info.}

\item{ignore_db}{If there are multiple time periods (particularly when there are 
very many time periods), you can pass in a data frame
(or tibble) with one row per person per time period and an indicator column 
\code{ignore} that is equal to 1 for periods that should be considered in sample
and 0 for periods for periods that should be considered out of sample. This is 
useful for excluding time periods from estimation for persons when they could not 
be present, i.e. such as before entrance into an organization or following death.
If \code{ignore} equals 0, the person's ideal point is estimated as a standard Normal
draw rather than an auto-correlated parameter, reducing computational 
burden substantially.
Note that there can only be one pre-sample period of 0s, one in-sample period of 1s,
and one post-sample period of 0s. Multiple in-sample periods cannot be interspersed
with out of sample periods. The columns must be labeled as \code{person_id}, 
\code{time_id} and \code{ignore} and must match the formatting of the columns
fed to the \code{id_make} function.}

\item{restrict_ind_high}{If \code{fixtype} is not "vb_full", the character value or numerical index
of a legislator/person or bill/item to pin to a high value (default +1).}

\item{fix_high}{The value of which the high fixed ideal point/item should be
fixed to. Default is +1.}

\item{fix_low}{The value of which the high fixed ideal point/item should be
fixed to. Default is -1.}

\item{restrict_ind_low}{If \code{fixtype} is not "vb_full", the character value or numerical index of a 
legislator/person or bill/item to pin to a low value (default -1).}

\item{fixtype}{Sets the particular kind of identification used on the model, could be either 'vb_full' 
(identification provided exclusively by running a variational identification model with no prior info), or
'prefix' (two indices of ideal points or items to fix are provided to 
options \code{restrict_ind_high} and \code{restrict_ind_low}).
 See details for more information.}

\item{const_type}{Whether \code{"persons"} are the parameters to be 
fixed for identification (the default) or \code{"items"}. Each of these
pinned parameters should be specified to \code{fix_high} and \code{fix_low}
if \code{fixtype} equals \code{"prefix"}, otherwise the model will
select the parameters to pin to fixed values.}

\item{id_refresh}{The number of times to report iterations from the variational run used to 
identify models. Default is 0 (nothing output to console).}

\item{prior_fit}{If a previous \code{idealstan} model was fit \emph{with the same} data, then the same
identification constraints can be recycled from the prior fit if the \code{idealstan} object is passed 
to this option. Note that means that all identification options, like \code{restrict_var}, will also 
be the same}

\item{warmup}{The number of iterations to use to calibrate Stan's sampler on a given model. Shouldn't be less than 100. 
See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more info.}

\item{ncores}{The number of cores in your computer to use for parallel processing in the Stan engine. 
See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more info. If \code{within_chain} is set to
\code{"threads"}, this parameter will determine the number of threads 
(independent processes) used for within-chain parallelization.}

\item{use_groups}{If \code{TRUE}, group parameters from the person/legis data given in \code{\link{id_make}} will be 
estimated instead of individual parameters.}

\item{discrim_reg_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation of the bimodal prior for the discrimination parameters for the non-inflated model.}

\item{discrim_miss_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation of the bimodal prior for the discrimination parameters for the inflated model.}

\item{person_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation for the legislators (persons) parameters}

\item{time_fix_sd}{The variance of the over-time component of the first person/legislator
is fixed to this value as a reference. 
Default is 0.1.}

\item{boundary_prior}{If your time series has very low variance (change over time),
you may want to use this option to put a boundary-avoiding inverse gamma prior on
the time series variance parameters if your model has a lot of divergent transitions. 
To do so, pass a list with a element called 
\code{beta} that signifies the rate parameter of the inverse-gamma distribution. 
For example, try \code{boundary_prior=list(beta=1)}. Increasing the value of \code{beta}
will increase the "push" away from zero. Setting it too high will result in 
time series that exhibit a lot of "wiggle" without much need.}

\item{time_center_cutoff}{The number of time points above which
the model will employ a centered time series approach for AR(1)
and random walk models. Below this number the model will employ a 
non-centered approach. The default is 50 time points, which is 
relatively arbitrary and higher values may be better if sampling
quality is poor above the threshold.}

\item{sample_stationary}{If \code{TRUE}, the AR(1) coefficients in a time-varying model will be 
sampled from an unconstrained space and then mapped back to a stationary space. Leaving this \code{TRUE} is 
slower but will work better when there is limited information to identify a model. If used, the
\code{ar_sd} parameter should be increased to 5 to allow for wider sampling in the unconstrained space.}

\item{ar_sd}{If an AR(1) model is used, this defines the prior scale of the Normal distribution. A lower number 
can help 
identify the model when there are few time points.}

\item{diff_reg_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation for the bill (item) intercepts for the non-inflated model.}

\item{diff_miss_sd}{Set the prior standard deviation for the bill (item) intercepts for the inflated model.}

\item{restrict_sd_high}{Set the prior standard deviation for pinned parameters. This has a default of 
0.01, but could be set lower if the data is really large.}

\item{restrict_sd_low}{Set the prior standard deviation for pinned parameters. This has a default of 
0.01, but could be set lower if the data is really large.}

\item{tol_rel_obj}{If \code{use_vb} is \code{TRUE}, this parameter sets the stopping rule for the \code{vb} algorithm. 
It's default is 0.001. A stricter threshold will require the sampler to run longer but may yield a
better result in a difficult model with highly correlated parameters. Lowering the threshold should work fine for simpler
models.}

\item{gp_sd_par}{The upper limit on allowed residual variation of the Gaussian process
prior. Increasing the limit will permit the GP to more closely follow the time points, 
resulting in much sharper bends in the function and potentially oscillation.}

\item{gp_num_diff}{The number of time points to use to calculate the length-scale prior
that determines the level of smoothness of the GP time process. Increasing this value
will result in greater smoothness/autocorrelation over time by selecting a greater number
of time points over which to calculate the length-scale prior.}

\item{gp_m_sd_par}{The upper limit of the marginal standard deviation of the GP time 
process. Decreasing this value will result in smoother fits.}

\item{gp_min_length}{The minimum value of the GP length-scale parameter. This is a hard
lower limit. Increasing this value will force a smoother GP fit. It should always be less than
\code{gp_num_diff}.}

\item{cmdstan_path_user}{Default is NULL, and so will default to whatever is set in
\code{cmdstanr} package. Specify a file path  here to use a different \code{cmdtstan}
installation.}

\item{map_over_id}{This parameter identifies which ID variable to use to construct the 
shards for within-chain parallelization. It defaults to \code{"persons"} but can also take
a value of \code{"items"}. It is recommended to select whichever variable has more
distinct values to improve parallelization.}

\item{save_files}{The location to save CSV files with MCMC draws from \code{cmdstanr}. 
The default is \code{NULL}, which will use a folder in the package directory.}

\item{pos_discrim}{Whether all discrimination parameters should be constrained to be
positive. If so, the model reduces to a traditional IRT model in which all items 
positively predict ability. Setting this to \code{TRUE} will also eliminate the need
to use other parameters for identification, though the options should still be 
specified to prevent errors.}

\item{het_var}{Whether to use a separate variance parameter for each item if using
Normal or Log-Normal distributions that have variance parameters. Defaults to TRUE and
should be set to FALSE only if all items have a similar variance.}

\item{compile_optim}{Whether to use Stan compile optimization flags (turn off if there
are any compile issues)}

\item{debug}{For debugging purposes, turns off threading to enable more informative
error messages from Stan. Also recompiles model objects.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed on to Stan's sampling engine. See \code{\link[rstan]{stan}} for more information.}

\item{gpu}{Whether a GPU is available to speed computation (primarily for GP 
time-varying models).}
}
\value{
A fitted \code{\link{idealstan}} object that contains posterior samples of all parameters either via full Bayesian inference
or a variational approximation if \code{use_vb} is set to \code{TRUE}. This object can then be passed to the plotting functions for further analysis.
}
\description{
This function will take a pre-processed \code{idealdata} vote/score dataframe and 
run one of the available IRT/latent space ideal point models on the data using
Stan's MCMC engine.
}
\details{
To run an IRT ideal point model, you must first pre-process your data using the \code{\link{id_make}} function. Be sure to specify the correct options for the
kind of model you are going to run: if you want to run an unbounded outcome (i.e. Poisson or continuous),
the data needs to be processed differently. Also any hierarchical covariates at the person or item level
need to be specified in \code{\link{id_make}}. If they are specified in \code{\link{id_make}}, than all 
subsequent models fit by this function will have these covariates.

\strong{Note that for static ideal point models, the covariates are only defined for those 
persons who are not being used as constraints.}

As of this version of \code{idealstan}, the following model types are available. Simply pass 
the number of the model in the list to the \code{model_type} option to fit the model.

\enumerate{
  \item IRT 2-PL (binary response) ideal point model, no missing-data inflation
  \item IRT 2-PL ideal point model (binary response) with missing- inflation
  \item Ordinal IRT (rating scale) ideal point model no missing-data inflation
  \item Ordinal IRT (rating scale) ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item Ordinal IRT (graded response) ideal point model no missing-data inflation
  \item Ordinal IRT (graded response) ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item Poisson IRT (Wordfish) ideal point model with no missing data inflation
  \item Poisson IRT (Wordfish) ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item unbounded (Gaussian) IRT ideal point model with no missing data
  \item unbounded (Gaussian) IRT ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item Positive-unbounded (Log-normal) IRT ideal point model with no missing data
  \item Positive-unbounded (Log-normal) IRT ideal point model with missing-data inflation
  \item Latent Space (binary response) ideal point model with no missing data
  \item Latent Space (binary response) ideal point model with missing-data inflation
}
}
\section{Identification}{

Identifying IRT models is challenging, and ideal point models are still more challenging 
because the discrimination parameters are not constrained.
As a result, more care must be taken to obtain estimates that are the same regardless of starting values. 
The parameter \code{fixtype} enables you to change the type of identification used. The default, 'vb_full', 
does not require any further
information from you in order for the model to be fit. In this version of identification, 
an unidentified model is run using
variational Bayesian inference (see \code{\link[rstan]{vb}}). The function will then select two 
persons/legislators or items/bills that end up on either end of the ideal point spectrum, 
and pin their ideal points
to those specific values. 
To control whether persons/legislator or items/bills are constrained,
the \code{const_type} can be set to either \code{"persons"} or 
\code{"items"} respectively. 
In many situations, it is prudent to select those persons or items 
ahead of time to pin to specific values. This allows the analyst to 
be more specific about what type of latent dimension is to be 
estimated. To do so, the \code{fixtype} option should be set to 
\code{"prefix"}. The values of the persons/items to be pinned can be passed
as character values to \code{restrict_ind_high} and 
\code{restrict_ind_low} to pin the high/low ends of the latent 
scale respectively. Note that these should be the actual data values 
passed to the \code{id_make} function. If you don't pass any values, 
you will see a prompt asking you to select certain values of persons/items.

The pinned values for persons/items are set by default to +1/-1, though
this can be changed using the \code{fix_high} and 
\code{fix_low} options. This pinned range is sufficient to identify 
all of the models
implemented in idealstan, though fiddling with some parameters may be 
necessary in difficult cases. For time-series models, one of the 
person ideal point over-time variances is also fixed to .1, a value that
can be changed using the option \code{time_fix_sd}.
