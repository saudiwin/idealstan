\title{Helper Function for \code{loo} calculation}
\usage{
derive_chain(ll_matrix = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ll_matrix}{A log-likelihood matrix as produced by the \code{\link[=id_post_pred]{id_post_pred()}}
function}
}
\description{
This function accepts a log-likelihood matrix produced by \code{id_post_pred} and
extracts the IDs of the MCMC chains. It is necessary to use this function
as the second argument to the \code{loo} function along with an exponentiated
log-likelihood matrix. See the package vignette How to Evaluate Models
for more details.
