#Release v0.7.2
* Updated to be compatible with most recent `rstan` (version 2.19.2).
* Added `id_plot_cov` function for marginal effects plotting of covariates.
* Added `id_plot_irf` for calculating impulse-response functions for AR(1) models covariates.

#Release v0.7.1
* Fixed bug where time series vignette did not show on CRAN screen

#Release v0.7.0
* Implement a Gaussian process prior for ideal points to permit semi-parametric inference
* Update `id_plot_legis_dyn` to allow for overlay plots comparing different time 
series models
* Strength over-time model identification using variational inference fits

#Release v0.6.0
* Set a stricter threshold for `vb` to `1e-04` to promote more robust variational inference

#Release v0.5.1
* Fixed bugs in plotting functions related to plotting two groups.
* Fixed bug in AR(1) model with restricted time variance.
* Updated dependencies to rstan 2.18.2.
* Added error-catching in covariate creation.

#Release v0.5.0
* New models for Poisson, ordinal-graded response, Normal and Log-normal outcomes.
* Time-varying ideal point processes: random-walks and auto-regressive priors.
* Time-varying plot functions for ideal points.
* Hierarchical covariates for ideal points and item/bill discrimination.
* Switched from matrix data input to long data frames.

#Release v0.2.9.1
* Fixed bugs in `id_extract` and `id_make` functions.

#Release v0.2.9
* Fixed a bug in the ideal point plot function, and also in the `auto_id` option in `id_estimate`.

# Release v0.2.2
* First release on CRAN.
* Fixed documentation issues from v0.2.1
